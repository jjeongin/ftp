Thoughtful Doris Khan
A Short Story
by Mr Pseudonym
Doris Khan was thinking about Zoe Randall again. Zoe was a clumsy brute with wobbly spots and greasy feet.

Doris walked over to the window and reflected on her grey surroundings. She had always loved idyllic Skegness with its knowledgeable, kooky kettles. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel sparkly.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a clumsy figure of Zoe Randall.

Doris gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a thoughtful, helpful, whiskey drinker with curvy spots and fluffy feet. Her friends saw her as a vigorous, violet vicar. Once, she had even saved a repulsive chicken that was stuck in a drain.

But not even a thoughtful person who had once saved a repulsive chicken that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Zoe had in store today.

The hail pounded like swimming rabbits, making Doris surprised. Doris grabbed a stripy hawk that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.

As Doris stepped outside and Zoe came closer, she could see the bad glint in her eye.

"I am here because I want a wifi code," Zoe bellowed, in a tight-fisted tone. She slammed her fist against Doris's chest, with the force of 5770 aardvarks. "I frigging love you, Doris Khan."

Doris looked back, even more surprised and still fingering the stripy hawk. "Zoe, you must think I was born yesterday," she replied.

They looked at each other with calm feelings, like two gigantic, gifted gerbils sleeping at a very deranged wake, which had piano music playing in the background and two predatory uncles walking to the beat.

Doris regarded Zoe's wobbly spots and greasy feet. She held out her hand. "Let's not fight," she whispered, gently.

"Hmph," pondered Zoe.

"Please?" begged Doris with puppy dog eyes.

Zoe looked sparkly, her body blushing like a harsh, high-pitched hat.

Then Zoe came inside for a nice glass of whiskey.
